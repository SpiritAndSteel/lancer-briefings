## Optional Mission
# SSC Special Comission

To the Honorable Captain Eriksen and the Pilots of the Lodestar,

My name is **Yamazaki Maia**, Aquisitions Lead of the Smith-Shimano Corpro's Exotic Materials Group. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

I have been in contact with **Rear Admiral Tran** regarding the illegal mercenary incursion in to one of the SSC's defunct holdings. I understand that the stakes of your mission are much greater than a simple matter of tresspassing, and the SSC has been happy to provide any useful data to Union to make sure the Mission is successful.

However, this puts us in a somewhat sticky legal position regarding intellectual property and data security. As the crew of the Lodestar are contractors and not members of Union Military, we must work out some arrangement to make sure SSC's holdings remain secure, and to ease any legal liabilty on your part regarding your imminent presence within one of our private facilities.

I have sent along a legal contract, including a non-disclosure agreement, for you to sign at your discression. Doing so will allow us to remit more sensitive data about the layout of the facility to you, as well as access to functioning local surveilance systems. This contract also comes with a sizeable signing bonus, as well as our gratitude. We ask only that any data, logs, media, or other information found within DZ-118 is given to us over the provided secure channel, and that such information remains priveleged in perpetuity. (I.E., not to be shared with any other individual, state, polity, corpro, or entity, public or private.)

I will be frank: Based on our records, the scientist in charge of research at the DZ-118 facility was fired due to breaches of ethics. Dr. Wallace was found to be conducting experiments outside our parameters, and was removed from the facility some 60 years ago and remited to Union custody. Our documentation on the matter is relatively sparse, however, and no thorough survey of the facility survives. Asphodel has remained low-priority on our list of holdings, but any data found therin remain company property, and we'd much prefer to have such information in hand than wasting away on a dead system. Aditionally, any leak of these records may provide damaging to our brand or harmful to the populace. 

Hopefully, retrieved data will allow us to investigate the incident at DZ-118 and better prevent anything similar from happening again.

Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated. I hope that we can work together on this. May it prove the start of a continued working relationship between us.

お忙しいところ恐縮ですが、ご返信を頂けますと幸いです。

Yamazaki Maia, AL, XMG-SSC
