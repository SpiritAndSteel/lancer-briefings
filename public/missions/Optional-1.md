# Optional Mission-1
## Retrieve SSC Data

**Kaitlyn Yamazaki**, of the **Smith-Shimano Corpro** Special Project Aquisitions Unit, has asked you to retrieve and remit any data or logs found within the **DZ-118 lab**. The scientist who ran the facility some 60 years ago, **Dr. Elizabeth Singh-Wallace**, apparently went a bit off-book in her research. The SSC would prefer her experiments do not become public knowledge, but still wish to obtain anything she may have discovered on company time. As such, you'll need to sign some incredibly strict NDAs. 

# Goals
- Discover what Dr. Wallace was working on, retrieve any surviving data, and return it to the SSC.

# Stakes
- Depending on the situation in the facility, you may be hard-pressed for time to complete this task
- Accepting this mission binds you legally from sharing any legacy information found within **DZ-118** to anyone besides the SSC, and their lawyers are legendary. But the bonus for completeing this task is pretty hefty.
- Not accepting this mission may instead put you in immediate legal danger, and permanently damage your reputation with the SSC.
