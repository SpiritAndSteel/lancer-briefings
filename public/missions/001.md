# Mission // #001
## As Above
# Goals
- Rescue USB Pilot asset: codename **Whistler** 
- Retrieve NHP casket: codename **Song**

# Optional Commisions
- Gain data on enemy force
- Discover what happened to Union Science vessel **Adelaide**
- **SSC Comission:** Retrieve data from derelict SSC base **DELTA ZULU-118** 


# Stakes
- Failure to retrieve BOTH **Whistler** and **Song** presents a security risk to all Union & allied polities
- Enemy forces unknown save for a small contingent of mercenaries: All major polities have denied attack. A new player in the region this close to the politically contested Dawnline Shore is a matter of vital importance.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
